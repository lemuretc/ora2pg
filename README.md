# ora2pg Docker 
* 20.0 [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Guy-Incognito/ora2pg/blob/20.0/Dockerfile) Uses ora2pg version [20.0](https://github.com/darold/ora2pg/releases/tag/v20.0)


Simple docker file that allows you to run ora2pg pod. I was using openshift Container Image and added run.sh file to keep POD up and running
So you can use CLI and run ora2pg multiple times with various configuration
